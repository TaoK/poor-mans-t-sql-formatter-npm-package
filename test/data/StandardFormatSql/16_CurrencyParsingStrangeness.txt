--Currency indicator processing is broken in T-SQL (2005). It appears to be the 
-- one place where a distinction is made between spaces and linebreaks. I can't 
-- (or don't want to) handle this, so I will assume that any whitespace between 
-- the currency symbol and a subsequent number means a 0-value currency amount and 
-- a subsequent subtracted number. This is NOT exactly how SQL Server handles it.

--This is NOT just a currency value: it's a currency value of 0, minus a decimal

-- break!
